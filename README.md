# 2023_Pietroiusti_etal_ESD Water balance model and analysis scripts used in Pietroiusti et al. 2023 "Possible role of anthropogenic climate change in the record-breaking 2020 Lake Victoria levels and floods" (submitted).<img src=/lakevic-eea-wbm/input_data/shapefiles/fig01.png alt="drawing" width="500" ALIGN=”left” />Figure: Vanderkelen et al., 2018, HESS## Water balance model`lakevic-eea-wbm` contains the water balance model component of the analysis, and can be run from the main `WBM_model.py` script. This model takes as input:1. Precipitation data, remapped using the provided grid specifications.    (a) observational run: PERSIANN-CDR 1983-2020   (b) attribution runs: GCM output historical and hist-nat bias adjusted with ISIMI3BASD from the ISIMIP3b round2. Evaporation data (provided) 3. Information on soil classes, land use, basin and lake shapefiles (provided)4. Outflow   (a) observational run: semi-observational outflow (provided)   (b) attribution runs: calculated using the Agreed Curve. `WBM_settings.py` acts as a namelist and should be modified to run the model under different scenarios and forcings, `WBM_inicon.py` initiates constants in the model, `WBM_inigeom.py` imports shapefiles and geoinformation about Lake Victoria and the basin.The water balance model is based on the MATLAB version developed in Vanderkelen et al. 2018, HESS, "Modelling the water balance of Lake Victoria".## Analysis of 2020 flood event`lakevic-eea-scripts` contains the analysis scripts used inthe attribution study. Scripts are divided into sections which correspond to the different sections of the analysis in the paper (0 preprocessing, 1 analysis of observational precipitation data, 2 lake levels analysis and interpolation, 3 event definition, 4 evaluation of the WBM, 5 analysis of WB drivers, 6 GCM evaluation, 7 statistical fits for attribution and synthesis results)## Data availability All data necessary to run the WBM is provided in this GitHub repository (`lakevic-eea-wbm/input-data/`), except for precipitation NetCDF fiels, which are available publicly, here:1. PERSIANN-CDR:2. ISIMIP3b CMIP6 GCMs: The location of precipitation files should be specified in WBM_settings.py. All data included in this repo is also archived on  [Zenodo][https://zenodo.org/record/8233523].## VersionVersion November 2023
